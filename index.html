    <h1>Carrie's Cape Town Adventure</h1>

        In December, George Lace and I traveled to Cape Town and the surrounding area for the adventure of a lifetime.  For both of us, it was our first time to Africa.  This page provides trip highlights and is useful whether you're spending a quarter abroad there or just looking for your next big adventure! Enjoy :)

    <h2>Cape Town</h2>
      <p>
        With both a beach and surrounding mountains, Cape Town offers a variety of activities! My top 5 activities are:
        <ul>
        <li>Table Mountain Hike and Repelling</li>
        <li>Robben Island Nelson Mandella Tour</li>
        <li>Boulder Beach Penquin Colony</li>
        <li>Cape Point / Cape of Good Hope </li>
        <li>Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    <h2>Stellenbosch</h2>
    <p>
        Stellenbosch is known for having some of the most beautiful wineries.  The great wine is followed by great cuisine, here are my top picks:
        <ul>
        <li>Ernie Els Winery</li>
        <li>La Petite Ferme Winery</li>
        <li>Hussan Grill</li>
        <li>Verde Lust Cafe</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    <h2>Inverdoorn Game Reserve</h2>
      <p>
        The Inverdoorn Game Reserve is only 2.5 hours north of wine country and offers a unique opportunity to see four of the "Big 5" animals!  Take a night-time and early morning safari drive with a tour guide to see some of Africa's most amazing wildlife.
      </p>
    <h2>Hermanus</h2>
        <p>
        Located along South Africa's Garden Route, Hermanus is one of South Africa's premiere beach towns.  If you're adventurous, it has fantastic whale watching and shark diving opportunities. 
        <ul>
        <li>Grotto Beach</li>
        <li>Gansbaii Shark Diving</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
