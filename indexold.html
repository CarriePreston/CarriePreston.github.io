    <h2>Inverdoorn Game Reserve</h2>
      <p>
        The Inverdoorn Game Reserve is only 2.5 hours north of wine country and offers a unique opportunity to see four of the "Big 5" animals!  Take a night-time and early morning safari drive with a tour guide to see some of Africa's most amazing wildlife.

        Below is a table of the animals you can expect to see at Inverdoorn:
    <div id="table">
    <table> Class="tableborder"
    <tr>
      <td>Lions</td>
      <td>There are three lions on the reserve, one male and two female. All three have been rescued from cage hunters.  Since they have never been in the wild, they do not know how to hunt and are fed each day by the caretakers of Inverdoorn</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Cheetahs</td>
      <td>There are two male cheetahs in the reserve.  Additionally, Inverdoorn has a cheetah rehibilitation center where they care for cheetahs before releasing them into the wild.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Rhinos</td>
      <td>There are three rhinos in the reserve which have to be carefully watched for fear of poachers.  In recent years, the Rhino popoulation has been declining due the rising value of the horns, which rhinos are killed for.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Giraffes</td>
      <td>There are 16 giraffe on the reserve.  15 of them can often be found together in a pack, while one older male tends to wander around by himself since he was kicked out of the pack by a younger male giraffe.</td>
    </tr>    
    <tr>
      <td>Hippos</td>
      <td>The two hippos located on the reserve can usually be found near one of the two lakes on the reserve since they spend a majority of their time near water.</td>
    </tr>
